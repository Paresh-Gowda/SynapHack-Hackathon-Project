# SynapHack Hackathon Project

SynapHack is a complete hackathon management platform built to foster innovation, collaboration, and creativity.
It enables organizers to host events, participants to join and compete, and teams to showcase their talent by building and submitting projects. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, SynapHack bridges the gap between organizers and innovators, making hackathons more engaging and productive.  

The platform provides an intuitive dashboard where users can explore upcoming events, view detailed descriptions, and participate in challenges that align with their skills.
A structured event detail page ensures that participants understand the purpose, theme, and goals of each hackathon before submission.
With the submission portal, teams can easily upload their projects, while organizers can monitor progress and evaluate entries seamlessly.  

SynapHack also integrates features like leaderboards, project submission tracking, and event creation for logged-in users.
Organizers can securely log in to create new events, review participant activity, and manage competition flow. 
This functionality ensures transparency, scalability, and flexibility for hosting hackathons of any size. 
The addition of a contact section allows participants to report issues or provide feedback, ensuring a smooth and collaborative experience for everyone involved.  

Built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, SynapHack reflects the spirit of hackathons: solving real-world problems through technology, teamwork, and creativity. 
Its clean UI, responsive design, and feature-rich workflow make it suitable for universities, organizations, or communities looking to nurture innovation. 
SynapHack is not just a project — it’s a platform that encourages talent, celebrates ideas, and creates opportunities for the next generation of innovators.
